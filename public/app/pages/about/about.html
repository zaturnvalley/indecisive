      <h1>What is indecisive?</h1>
        <p>Indecisive is a site that helps you solve your indecision. The idea came about when creator Zach Mason was a kid and took a half-hour to decide what donut to buy. Should I get a maple or chocolate donut. Which is better? Which did he like most often? This site aims to track data from the user and supply information to inform based upon prior experiences.</p>
